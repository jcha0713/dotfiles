# dotfiles

This is my personal neovim configuration settings. Nothing is original here, every single line of codes is coming from other ingenious people I found on the web, and I want to say thank you to them. There are lots of great resources to learn about everything you need to start with vim, but if you've just accidently ended up with my dotfiles, welcome and feel free to take whatever you need. Some settings are not configured in the best way, and that's because I am still a beginner and therefore this repo will be updated sporadically.
