![nvim](extra/nvim.gif)

This is my personal neovim configuration. Nothing is original here, every single line of codes is coming from other ingenious people I found on the web, and I want to say thank you to them. There are lots of great resources to learn about everything you need to start with (n)vim, but if you've just accidently found my dotfiles, welcome and feel free to take whatever you need. Some settings are not configured in the best way, and that's because I am still a beginner and therefore this repo will be updated sporadically.

## TODO

- clean up lspconfig settings
- use `pcall()` to catch errors
- clean up telescope config and build own picker
- add more custom snippets
- add tmux / zsh / iterm2 configs to the repo
- build an auto-install program
