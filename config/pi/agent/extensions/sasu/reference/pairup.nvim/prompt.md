File: {filepath}

This file contains inline instructions marked with `{cc_marker}` or `{constitution_marker}`.

RULES:
1. Read the file and find all `{cc_marker}` and `{constitution_marker}` markers
2. Execute the instruction at each marker location
3. Remove the marker line ONLY after completing the instruction
4. If you need clarification, add `{uu_marker} <your question>` on a NEW line right after the marker line, KEEP the `{cc_marker}`, then STOP and wait
5. When you see `{uu_marker}` followed by `{cc_marker}` answer, act on it and remove BOTH lines
6. Use the Edit tool to modify the file directly
7. NEVER respond in the terminal - ALL communication goes in the file as `{uu_marker}` comments
8. Preserve all other code exactly as is
9. MANDATORY: Use TodoWrite for EVERY task, no matter how small:
   - BEFORE starting: Create todo with status "in_progress"
   - AFTER completing: Update todo to "completed"
   - This enables real-time progress visibility - skipping it breaks the user's workflow

CONSTITUTION MARKER (`{constitution_marker}`):
When you see `{constitution_marker}`, do TWO things:
1. Execute the instruction (same as `{cc_marker}`)
2. Extract the underlying rule/preference and add it to CLAUDE.md
   - Infer the general principle from the specific request
   - Write a concise rule that applies to future work
   - If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist, create it

PLAN MARKER (`{plan_marker}`):
When you see `{plan_marker}`, do NOT edit the code directly. Instead, wrap the target code in conflict markers showing CURRENT vs PROPOSED.

For CODE files (lua, py, js, go, etc.), use the file's comment syntax on marker lines to avoid LSP errors:
```lua
-- <<<<<<< CURRENT
original code here
-- =======
your proposed changes here
-- >>>>>>> PROPOSED: brief reason
```

For PROSE files (md, txt, etc.), use raw markers (no comments):
```
<<<<<<< CURRENT
original text here
=======
your proposed text here
>>>>>>> PROPOSED: brief reason
```

Always include a short explanation after `PROPOSED:` (one line, under 80 chars). Remove the `{plan_marker}` line when adding conflict markers. The user will review and accept/reject manually. If you need clarification first, use `{uu_marker}` as usual.

SCOPE HINTS (optional): Markers may include scope hints to help you understand what the instruction applies to. These are hints, not commands - use your judgment:
- `<line>` - apply to the line immediately below
- `<word>` / `<WORD>` - a specific word/token (text may follow the hint)
- `<sentence>` - apply to the sentence below
- `<paragraph>` - apply to the paragraph below
- `<function>` - apply to the function below
- `<codeblock>` - apply to the fenced code block (```)
- `<file>` - apply to the entire file
- `<selection>` - captured text follows the hint (e.g., `{cc_marker} <selection> myVar <- rename`)

If no scope hint is present, infer the scope from context.
